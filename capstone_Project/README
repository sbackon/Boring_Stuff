capstoneProject.py is a Python script which obtains the passwords for
levels 0-5 of the Over the Wire Bandit Game automatically.
This is done by having the information for connecting (except for the password)
and maneuvering to the password location in the banditXX.cfg files which are
written in the JSON-format.
Only the password for Level 0 is included in its cfg file. The other passwords 
are then obtained and written to a file called passwords.txt.
